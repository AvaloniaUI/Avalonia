      org.a11y.atspi.Accessible:
      @short_description: Base interface which is implemented by all accessible objects.
  -->
  <interface name="org.a11y.atspi.Accessible">

    <!--
        Name: Human-readable, localized, short name for the object.

        Normally you need to set this for objects which do not have a labelled-by
        relation.  Consider a widget to select RGB colors by setting three sliders.  The
        names for the sliders would be "Red", "Green", "Blue", respectively, or
        translations to application's locale.  The names would be unnecessary if each
        slider had a labelled-by relation to corresponding labels visible in the user
        interface.

        In general, something is missing from your application if an object that can be
        interacted with has no Name or a labelled-by relation.
    -->
    <property name="Name" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        Description: Human-readable, localized description of the object in more detail.

        While the Name property is meant to be a short string that screen readers say
        during normal navigation, the Description property is for when the user asks for
        more detail.
    -->
    <property name="Description" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        Parent: Accessible parent object of the current object.

        The (so) is a string for the application name, and an object path.

        Null parent: If the object has no parent (e.g. the application's root object is
        being queried), return "" for the application name name and "/org/a11y/atspi/null"
        for the object path.

        Root object: An application must have a single root object, called
        "/org/a11y/atspi/accessible/root".  All other objects should have that one as
        their highest-level ancestor.
    -->
    <property name="Parent" type="(so)" access="read">
      <annotation name="org.qtproject.QtDBus.QtTypeName" value="QSpiObjectReference"/>

    <!--
        ChildCount: number of accessible children for this object.
    -->
    <property name="ChildCount" type="i" access="read"/>

    <!--
        Locale: Unix locale for the current object.

        For an application, this may be the locale for the language that the application
        shows in its user interface.

        For a document being shown in an application, or a paragraph within a document,
        the locale may refer to that object exclusively.  For example, an application may
        be showing itself in English ("en"), but it may be used to display a document in
        Spanish ("es").  In the latter case, a screen reader will want to know that it
        should switch to Spanish while reading the document.
    -->
    <property name="Locale" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        AccessibleId: application-specific identifier for the current object.

        You can use this to give a special id to an object to use in tests, for example,
        "my_widget".  Note that there is no way to directly find an object by its id; your
        test program may have to recursively get the children to find a specific id.  This
        is because accessible objects can be created dynamically, and they do not always
        correspond to a static view of an application's data.
    -->
    <property name="AccessibleId" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        HelpText: help text for the current object.
    -->
    <property name="HelpText" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!--
        GetChildAtIndex:
        @index: 0-based index of the child to query.

        Queries the Nth accessible child of the current object.  It is expected that this
        will correspond to the order that the GetChildren method would return.

        Returns: The (so) is a string for the application name, and an object path.

        Notes: implementations vary in their behavior when the index is out of range.
        GTK4 returns an error, while atk-adaptor returns the null object path
        "/org/a11y/atspi/null".  To keep the type system gods happy, you should probably
        return a DBus error in that case.
    -->
    <method name="GetChildAtIndex">

    <!--
        GetChildren:

        Returns a list of the object's accessible children.

        Each array element (so) is a string for the application name, and an object path.

        GetIndexInParent:

        Returns the 0-based index at which the object would be returned by calling
        GetChildren on its parent, or -1 if the object has no containing
        parent or on exception.
    -->
    <method name="GetIndexInParent">
      <arg direction="out" type="i"/>
    </method>

    <!--
        GetRelationSet:

        Returns a set of relationships between the current object and others.  Each
        element in the outermost array contains a number that indicates the relation type
        (see below), and an array of references to accessible objects to which that
        relationship applies.  Each element in the inner array is a (so) with a string for
        the application name, and an object path.

        Each relationship between objects (possibly one-to-many or many-to-one) allows
        better semantic identification of how objects are associated with one another.
        For instance, the ATSPI_RELATION_LABELLED_BY relationship may be used to identify
        labelling information that should accompany the accessible name property when
        presenting an object's content or identity to the end user.  Similarly,
        ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR can be used to further specify the context in which
        a valuator is useful, and/or the other UI components which are directly effected
        by user interactions with the valuator. Common examples include association of
        scrollbars with the viewport or panel which they control.

        Relation types - these are the enum values from AtspiRelationType in atspi-constants.h:

        0 - ATSPI_RELATION_NULL: Not a meaningful relationship; clients should not
            normally encounter this value.

        1 - ATSPI_RELATION_LABEL_FOR: Object is a label for one or more other objects.

        2 - ATSPI_RELATION_LABELLED_BY: Object is labelled by one or more other
            objects.

        3 - ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR: Object is an interactive object which
            modifies the state, onscreen location, or other attributes of one or more
            target objects.

        4 - ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLED_BY: Object state, position, etc. is
            modified/controlled by user interaction with one or more other objects.
            For instance a viewport or scroll pane may be ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLED_BY
            scrollbars.

        5 - ATSPI_RELATION_MEMBER_OF: Object has a grouping relationship (e.g. 'same
            group as') to one or more other objects.

        6 - ATSPI_RELATION_TOOLTIP_FOR: Object is a tooltip associated with another
            object.

        7 - ATSPI_RELATION_NODE_CHILD_OF: Object is a child of the target.

        8 - ATSPI_RELATION_NODE_PARENT_OF: Object is a parent of the target.

        9 - ATSPI_RELATION_EXTENDED: Used to indicate that a relationship exists, but
           its type is not specified in the enumeration.

        10 - ATSPI_RELATION_FLOWS_TO: Object renders content which flows logically to
             another object. For instance, text in a paragraph may flow to another
             object which is not the 'next sibling' in the accessibility hierarchy.

        11 - ATSPI_RELATION_FLOWS_FROM: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_FLOWS_TO.

        12 - ATSPI_RELATION_SUBWINDOW_OF: Object is visually and semantically considered
             a subwindow of another object, even though it is not the object's child.
             Useful when dealing with embedded applications and other cases where the
             widget hierarchy does not map cleanly to the onscreen presentation.

        13 - ATSPI_RELATION_EMBEDS: Similar to ATSPI_RELATION_SUBWINDOW_OF, but
             specifically used for cross-process embedding.

        14 - ATSPI_RELATION_EMBEDDED_BY: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_EMBEDS. Used to
             denote content rendered by embedded renderers that live in a separate process
             space from the embedding context.

        15 - ATSPI_RELATION_POPUP_FOR: Denotes that the object is a transient window or
             frame associated with another onscreen object. Similar to ATSPI_TOOLTIP_FOR,
             but more general. Useful for windows which are technically toplevels
             but which, for one or more reasons, do not explicitly cause their
             associated window to lose 'window focus'. Creation of an ATSPI_ROLE_WINDOW
             object with the ATSPI_RELATION_POPUP_FOR relation usually requires
             some presentation action on the part of assistive technology clients,
             even though the previous toplevel ATSPI_ROLE_FRAME object may still be
             the active window.

        16 - ATSPI_RELATION_PARENT_WINDOW_OF: This is the reciprocal relation to
             ATSPI_RELATION_POPUP_FOR.

        17 - ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY.
             Indicates that this object provides descriptive information about the target
             object(s). See also ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR and ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_FOR.

        18 - ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR.
             Indicates that one or more target objects provide descriptive information
             about this object. This relation type is most appropriate for information
             that is not essential as its presentation may be user-configurable and/or
             limited to an on-demand mechanism such as an assistive technology command.
             For brief, essential information such as can be found in a widget's on-screen
             label, use ATSPI_RELATION_LABELLED_BY. For an on-screen error message, use
             ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE. For lengthy extended descriptive information
             contained in an on-screen object, consider using ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS as
             assistive technologies may provide a means for the user to navigate to
             objects containing detailed descriptions so that their content can be more
             closely reviewed.

        19 - ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR. Indicates
             that this object has a detailed or extended description, the contents of
             which can be found in the target object(s). This relation type is most
             appropriate for information that is sufficiently lengthy as to make
             navigation to the container of that information desirable. For less verbose
             information suitable for announcement only, see ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY.
             If the detailed information describes an error condition,
             ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_FOR should be used instead.  Since 2.26.

        20 - ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS. Indicates
             that this object provides a detailed or extended description about the target
             object(s). See also ATSPI_RELATION_DESCRIPTION_FOR and ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_FOR.
             Since 2.26.

        21 - ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_FOR.
             Indicates that this object has one or more errors, the nature of which is
             described in the contents of the target object(s). Objects that have this
             relation type should also contain ATSPI_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY when their
             GetState method is called.  Since: 2.26.

        22 - ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_FOR: Reciprocal of ATSPI_RELATION_ERROR_MESSAGE.
             Indicates that this object contains an error message describing an invalid
             condition in the target object(s). Since: 2.26.

    <!--
        GetRole:

        Gets the accessible role that the current object represents.  Roles make it
        possible for various UI toolkits to expose their controls to assistive
        technologies (ATs) with a standard interface, regardless of toolkit.  For example,
        a widget that acts like a conventional push button (appears unpressed; presses
        when acted upon; invokes a certain action when pressed) can expose an
        ATSPI_ROLE_PUSH_BUTTON role.

        Role values - these are the enum values from AtspiRole in atspi-constants.h:

        0 - ATSPI_ROLE_INVALID: A role indicating an error condition, such as
            uninitialized Role data.

        1 - ATSPI_ROLE_ACCELERATOR_LABEL: Object is a label indicating the keyboard

            kind.

        4 - ATSPI_ROLE_ARROW: Object is a 2D directional indicator.

        5 - ATSPI_ROLE_CALENDAR: Object contains one or more dates, usually arranged
            into a 2D list.

        6 - ATSPI_ROLE_CANVAS: Object that can be drawn into and is used to trap
            events.

        18 - ATSPI_ROLE_DRAWING_AREA: An object used for drawing custom user interface
             elements.

        19 - ATSPI_ROLE_FILE_CHOOSER: A specialized dialog that displays the files in
             the directory and lets the user select a file, browse a different
             directory, or specify a filename.

        20 - ATSPI_ROLE_FILLER: A object that fills up space in a user interface.

        21 - ATSPI_ROLE_FOCUS_TRAVERSABLE: Don't use, reserved for future use.

        23 - ATSPI_ROLE_FRAME: A top level window with a title bar, border, menubar,
             etc.

        24 - ATSPI_ROLE_GLASS_PANE: A pane that is guaranteed to be painted on top of
             all panes beneath it.

        25 - ATSPI_ROLE_HTML_CONTAINER: A document container for HTML, whose children
             represent the document content.

        26 - ATSPI_ROLE_ICON: A small fixed size picture, typically used to decorate

        29 - ATSPI_ROLE_LABEL: An object used to present an icon or short string in an
             interface.

        30 - ATSPI_ROLE_LAYERED_PANE: A specialized pane that allows its children to be
             drawn in layers, providing a form of stacking order.

        31 - ATSPI_ROLE_LIST: An object that presents a list of objects to the user and
             allows the user to select one or more of them.

        32 - ATSPI_ROLE_LIST_ITEM: An object that represents an element of a list.

        34 - ATSPI_ROLE_MENU_BAR: An object usually drawn at the top of the primary
             dialog box of an application that contains a list of menus the user can
             choose from.

        35 - ATSPI_ROLE_MENU_ITEM: An object usually contained in a menu that presents
             an action the user can choose.

        38 - ATSPI_ROLE_PAGE_TAB_LIST: An object that presents a series of panels (or
             page tabs), one at a time,through some mechanism provided by the
             object.

        39 - ATSPI_ROLE_PANEL: A generic container that is often used to group objects.

        40 - ATSPI_ROLE_PASSWORD_TEXT: A text object uses for passwords, or other places
             where the text content is not shown visibly to the user.

        41 - ATSPI_ROLE_POPUP_MENU: A temporary window that is usually used to offer the
             user a list of choices, and then hides when the user selects one of those
             choices.

        42 - ATSPI_ROLE_PROGRESS_BAR: An object used to indicate how much of a task has
             been completed.

             viewport along a one-dimensional axis.

        49 - ATSPI_ROLE_SCROLL_PANE: An object that allows a user to incrementally view
             a large amount of information. Scroll pane objects are usually
             accompanied by ATSPI_ROLE_SCROLL_BAR controllers, on which the
             ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR and ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLED_BY
             reciprocal relations are set. See the GetRelationSet method.

        50 - ATSPI_ROLE_SEPARATOR: An object usually contained in a menu to provide a
             visible and logical separation of the contents in a menu.

        51 - ATSPI_ROLE_SLIDER: An object that allows the user to select from a bounded range.
             Unlike ATSPI_ROLE_SCROLL_BAR, ATSPI_ROLE_SLIDER objects need not control
             'viewport'-like objects.

        52 - ATSPI_ROLE_SPIN_BUTTON: An object which allows one of a set of choices to
             be selected, and which displays the current choice.

        53 - ATSPI_ROLE_SPLIT_PANE: A specialized panel that presents two other panels
             at the same time.

        54 - ATSPI_ROLE_STATUS_BAR: Object displays non-quantitative status information
             (c.f. ATSPI_ROLE_PROGRESS_BAR)

        55 - ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE: An object used to represent information in terms of rows
             and columns.

        56 - ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_CELL: A 'cell' or discrete child within a Table. Note:
             Table cells need not have ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_CELL, other
             role values are valid as well.

        57 - ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_COLUMN_HEADER: An object which labels a particular column
             in a Table interface interface.

        58 - ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_ROW_HEADER: An object which labels a particular row in a
             Table interface. Table rows and columns may also be labelled via the
             ATSPI_RELATION_LABEL_FOR/ATSPI_RELATION_LABELLED_BY relationships; see
             the GetRelationSet method.

        59 - ATSPI_ROLE_TEAROFF_MENU_ITEM: Object allows menu to be removed from menubar
             and shown in its own window.

        60 - ATSPI_ROLE_TERMINAL: An object that emulates a terminal.

        61 - ATSPI_ROLE_TEXT: An interactive widget that supports multiple lines of text
             and optionally accepts user input, but whose purpose is not to solicit user
             input. Thus ATSPI_ROLE_TEXT is appropriate for the text view in a plain text
             editor but inappropriate for an input field in a dialog box or web form. For
             widgets whose purpose is to solicit input from the user, see ATSPI_ROLE_ENTRY
             and ATSPI_ROLE_PASSWORD_TEXT. For generic objects which display a brief amount
             of textual information, see ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC.

        62 - ATSPI_ROLE_TOGGLE_BUTTON: A specialized push button that can be checked or
             unchecked, but does not procide a separate indicator for the current
             state.

        63 - ATSPI_ROLE_TOOL_BAR: A bar or palette usually composed of push buttons or
             toggle buttons.

        64 - ATSPI_ROLE_TOOL_TIP: An object that provides information about another
             object.

        65 - ATSPI_ROLE_TREE: An object used to repsent hierarchical information to the
             user.

        66 - ATSPI_ROLE_TREE_TABLE: An object that presents both tabular and
             hierarchical info to the user.

        67 - ATSPI_ROLE_UNKNOWN: The object contains some accessible information,
             but its role is not known.

        68 - ATSPI_ROLE_VIEWPORT: An object usually used in a scroll pane, or to
             otherwise clip a larger object or content renderer to a specific
             onscreen viewport.

        69 - ATSPI_ROLE_WINDOW: A top level window with no title or border.

        70 - ATSPI_ROLE_EXTENDED: means that the role for this item is known, but not
             included in the core enumeration. Deprecated since 2.24.

        71 - ATSPI_ROLE_HEADER: An object that serves as a document header.

        72 - ATSPI_ROLE_FOOTER: An object that serves as a document footer.

        73 - ATSPI_ROLE_PARAGRAPH: An object which is contains a single paragraph of
             text content. See also ATSPI_ROLE_TEXT.

        74 - ATSPI_ROLE_RULER: An object which describes margins and tab stops, etc.
             for text objects which it controls (should have
             ATSPI_RELATION_CONTROLLER_FOR relation to such).

        75 - ATSPI_ROLE_APPLICATION: An object corresponding to the toplevel accessible
             of an application, which may contain ATSPI_ROLE_FRAME objects or other
             accessible objects. Children of objects with the ATSPI_ROLE_DESKTOP_FRAME role
             are generally ATSPI_ROLE_APPLICATION objects.

        76 - ATSPI_ROLE_AUTOCOMPLETE: The object is a dialog or list containing items
             for insertion into an entry widget, for instance a list of words for
             completion of a text entry.

        77 - ATSPI_ROLE_EDITBAR: The object is an editable text object in a toolbar.

        78 - ATSPI_ROLE_EMBEDDED: The object is an embedded component container.  This
             role is a "grouping" hint that the contained objects share a context
             which is different from the container in which this accessible is
             embedded. In particular, it is used for some kinds of document embedding,
             and for embedding of out-of-process component, "panel applets", etc.

        79 - ATSPI_ROLE_ENTRY: The object is a component whose textual content may be
             entered or modified by the user, provided ATSPI_STATE_EDITABLE is present.
             A readonly ATSPI_ROLE_ENTRY object (i.e. where ATSPI_STATE_EDITABLE is
             not present) implies a read-only 'text field' in a form, as opposed to a
             title, label, or caption.

        80 - ATSPI_ROLE_CHART: The object is a graphical depiction of quantitative data.
             It may contain multiple subelements whose attributes and/or description
             may be queried to obtain both the  quantitative data and information about
             how the data is being presented. The ATSPI_LABELLED_BY relation is
             particularly important in interpreting objects of this type, as is the
             accessible description property. See ATSPI_ROLE_CAPTION.

        81 - ATSPI_ROLE_CAPTION: The object contains descriptive information, usually
             textual, about another user interface element such as a table, chart, or
             image.

        82 - ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME: The object is a visual frame or container which
             contains a view of document content.  Document frames may occur within
             another Document instance, in which case the second document may be
             said to be embedded in the containing instance.  HTML frames are often
             ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME:  Either this object, or a singleton descendant,
             should implement the org.a11y.atspi.Document interface.

        83 - ATSPI_ROLE_HEADING: The object serves as a heading for content which
             follows it in a document. The 'heading level' of the heading, if
             availabe,  may be obtained by       querying the object's attributes.

        84 - ATSPI_ROLE_PAGE: The object is a containing instance which encapsulates a
             page of information. ATSPI_ROLE_PAGE is used in documents and content which
             support a paginated navigation model.

        85 - ATSPI_ROLE_SECTION: The object is a containing instance of document content
             which constitutes a particular 'logical' section of the document.  The
             type of content within a section, and the nature of the section division
             itself, may be obtained by querying the object's attributes.  Sections
             may be nested.

        86 - ATSPI_ROLE_REDUNDANT_OBJECT: The object is redundant with another object in
             the hierarchy, and is exposed for purely technical reasons.  Objects of
             this role should be ignored by clients, if they are encountered at all.

        87 - ATSPI_ROLE_FORM: The object is a containing instance of document content
             which has within it components with which the user can interact in order
             to input information; i.e. the object is a container for pushbuttons,
             comboboxes, text input fields, and other 'GUI' components. ATSPI_ROLE_FORM
             should not, in general, be used for toplevel GUI containers or dialogs,
             but should be reserved for 'GUI' containers which occur within document
             content, for instance within Web documents, presentations, or text
             documents.  Unlike other GUI containers and dialogs which occur inside
             application instances, ATSPI_ROLE_FORM containers' components are
             associated with the current document, rather than the current foreground
             application or viewer instance.

        88 - ATSPI_ROLE_LINK: The object is a hypertext anchor, i.e. a "link" in a
             hypertext document.  Such objects are distinct from 'inline' content
             which may also use the Hypertext/Hyperlink interfaces to indicate
             the range/location within a text object where an inline or embedded object
             lies.

        89 - ATSPI_ROLE_INPUT_METHOD_WINDOW: The object is a window or similar viewport
             which is used to allow composition or input of a 'complex character',
             in other words it is an "input method window".

        90 - ATSPI_ROLE_TABLE_ROW: A row in a table.

        91 - ATSPI_ROLE_TREE_ITEM: An object that represents an element of a tree.

        92 - ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_SPREADSHEET: A document frame which contains a
             spreadsheet.

        93 - ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_PRESENTATION: A document frame which contains a
             presentation or slide content.

             such as found in a word processing application.

        95 - ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_WEB: A document frame which contains HTML or other
             markup suitable for display in a web browser.

        96 - ATSPI_ROLE_DOCUMENT_EMAIL: A document frame which contains email content
             to be displayed or composed either in plain text or HTML.

        97 - ATSPI_ROLE_COMMENT: An object found within a document and designed to
             present a comment, note, or other annotation. In some cases, this object
             might not be visible until activated.

        98 - ATSPI_ROLE_LIST_BOX: A non-collapsible list of choices the user can select from.

        99 - ATSPI_ROLE_GROUPING: A group of related widgets. This group typically has a label.

        100 - ATSPI_ROLE_IMAGE_MAP: An image map object. Usually a graphic with multiple
              hotspots, where each hotspot can be activated resulting in the loading of
              another document or section of a document.

        101 - ATSPI_ROLE_NOTIFICATION: A transitory object designed to present a
              message to the user, typically at the desktop level rather than inside a
              particular application.

        102 - ATSPI_ROLE_INFO_BAR: An object designed to present a message to the user
              within an existing window.

        103 - ATSPI_ROLE_LEVEL_BAR: A bar that serves as a level indicator to, for
              instance, show the strength of a password or the state of a battery. Since: 2.8

        104 - ATSPI_ROLE_TITLE_BAR: A bar that serves as the title of a window or a
              dialog. Since: 2.12

        105 - ATSPI_ROLE_BLOCK_QUOTE: An object which contains a text section
              that is quoted from another source.  Since: 2.12

        106 - ATSPI_ROLE_AUDIO: An object which represents an audio
              element. Since: 2.12

        107 - ATSPI_ROLE_VIDEO: An object which represents a video
              element. Since: 2.12

        108 - ATSPI_ROLE_DEFINITION: A definition of a term or concept. Since: 2.12

        109 - ATSPI_ROLE_ARTICLE: A section of a page that consists of a
              composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or
              site. Examples: A blog entry, a news story, a forum post. Since: 2.12

        110 - ATSPI_ROLE_LANDMARK: A region of a web page intended as a
              navigational landmark. This is designed to allow Assistive
              Technologies to provide quick navigation among key regions within a
              document. Since: 2.12

        111 - ATSPI_ROLE_LOG: A text widget or container holding log content, such
              as chat history and error logs. In this role there is a
              relationship between the arrival of new items in the log and the
              reading order. The log contains a meaningful sequence and new
              information is added only to the end of the log, not at arbitrary
              points. Since: 2.12

        112 - ATSPI_ROLE_MARQUEE: A container where non-essential information
              changes frequently. Common usages of marquee include stock tickers
              and ad banners. The primary difference between a marquee and a log
              is that logs usually have a meaningful order or sequence of
              important content changes. Since: 2.12

        113 - ATSPI_ROLE_MATH: A text widget or container that holds a mathematical
              expression. Since: 2.12

        114 - ATSPI_ROLE_RATING: A widget whose purpose is to display a rating,
              such as the number of stars associated with a song in a media
              player. Objects of this role should also implement
              the Value interface. Since: 2.12

        115 - ATSPI_ROLE_TIMER: An object containing a numerical counter which
              indicates an amount of elapsed time from a start point, or the time
              remaining until an end point. Since: 2.12

        116 - ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC: A generic non-container object whose purpose is to display
              a brief amount of information to the user and whose role is known by the
              implementor but lacks semantic value for the user. Examples in which
              ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC is appropriate include the message displayed in a message
              box and an image used as an alternative means to display text.
              ATSPI_ROLE_STATIC should not be applied to widgets which are traditionally
              interactive, objects which display a significant amount of content, or any
              object which has an accessible relation pointing to another object. The
              displayed information, as a general rule, should be exposed through the
              accessible name of the object. For labels which describe another widget, see
              ATSPI_ROLE_LABEL. For text views, see ATSPI_ROLE_TEXT. For generic
              containers, see ATSPI_ROLE_PANEL. For objects whose role is not known by the
              implementor, see ATSPI_ROLE_UNKNOWN. Since: 2.16.

        117 - ATSPI_ROLE_MATH_FRACTION: An object that represents a mathematical fraction. Since: 2.16.

        118 - ATSPI_ROLE_MATH_ROOT: An object that represents a mathematical expression
              displayed with a radical. Since: 2.16.

        119 - ATSPI_ROLE_SUBSCRIPT: An object that contains text that is displayed as a
              subscript. Since: 2.16.

        120 - ATSPI_ROLE_SUPERSCRIPT: An object that contains text that is displayed as a
              superscript. Since: 2.16.

        121 - ATSPI_ROLE_DESCRIPTION_LIST: An object that represents a list of term-value
              groups. A term-value group represents an individual description and consist
              of one or more names (ATSPI_ROLE_DESCRIPTION_TERM) followed by one or more
              values (ATSPI_ROLE_DESCRIPTION_VALUE). For each list, there should not be
              more than one group with the same term name. Since: 2.26.

        122 - ATSPI_ROLE_DESCRIPTION_TERM: An object that represents a term or phrase
              with a corresponding definition. Since: 2.26.

        123 - ATSPI_ROLE_DESCRIPTION_VALUE: An object that represents the description,
              definition, or value of a term. Since: 2.26.

        124 - ATSPI_ROLE_FOOTNOTE: An object that contains the text of a footnote. Since: 2.26.

        125 - ATSPI_ROLE_CONTENT_DELETION: Content previously deleted or proposed to be
              deleted, e.g. in revision history or a content view providing suggestions
              from reviewers. Since: 2.34.

        126 - ATSPI_ROLE_CONTENT_INSERTION: Content previously inserted or proposed to be
              inserted, e.g. in revision history or a content view providing suggestions
              from reviewers. Since: 2.34.

        127 - ATSPI_ROLE_MARK: A run of content that is marked or highlighted, such as for
              reference purposes, or to call it out as having a special purpose. If the
              marked content has an associated section in the document elaborating on the
              reason for the mark, then an ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS relation should be used on the mark
              to point to that associated section. In addition, the reciprocal relation
              ATSPI_RELATION_DETAILS_FOR should be used on the associated content section
              to point back to the mark. See the GetRelationSet method. Since: 2.36.

        128 - ATSPI_ROLE_SUGGESTION: A container for content that is called out as a
              proposed change from the current version of the document, such as by a reviewer of
              the content. An object with this role should include children with
              ATSPI_ROLE_CONTENT_DELETION and/or ATSPI_ROLE_CONTENT_INSERTION, in any order, to
              indicate what the actual change is. Since: 2.36

        129 - ATSPI_ROLE_PUSH_BUTTON_MENU: A specialized push button to open a menu. Since: 2.46

        GetState:

        Gets the set of states currently held by an object.

        Elements in the array are enumeration values from AtspiStateType in atspi-constants.h:

        0 - ATSPI_STATE_INVALID: Indicates an invalid state - probably an error
            condition.

        1 - ATSPI_STATE_ACTIVE: Indicates a window is currently the active window, or
            an object is the active subelement within a container or table. ATSPI_STATE_ACTIVE
            should not be used for objects which have ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSABLE or
            ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE: Those objects should use
            ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSED and ATSPI_STATE_SELECTED respectively.
            ATSPI_STATE_ACTIVE is a means to indicate that an object which is not
            focusable and not selectable is the currently-active item within its
            parent container.

        2 - ATSPI_STATE_ARMED: Indicates that the object is armed.

        3 - ATSPI_STATE_BUSY: Indicates the current object is busy, i.e. onscreen
            representation is in the process of changing, or the object is
            temporarily unavailable for interaction due to activity already in progress.

        4 - ATSPI_STATE_CHECKED: Indicates this object is currently checked.

        5 - ATSPI_STATE_COLLAPSED: Indicates this object is collapsed.

        6 - ATSPI_STATE_DEFUNCT: Indicates that this object no longer has a valid
            backing widget (for instance, if its peer object has been destroyed).

        7 - ATSPI_STATE_EDITABLE: Indicates the user can change the contents of this
            object.

        8 - ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED: Indicates that this object is enabled, i.e. that it
            currently reflects some application state. Objects that are "greyed out"
            may lack this state, and may lack the ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE if direct
            user interaction cannot cause them to acquire ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED.
            See ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE.

        9 - ATSPI_STATE_EXPANDABLE: Indicates this object allows progressive
            disclosure of its children.

        10 - ATSPI_STATE_EXPANDED: Indicates this object is expanded.

        11 - ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSABLE: Indicates this object can accept keyboard focus,
             which means all events resulting from typing on the keyboard will
             normally be passed to it when it has focus.

        12 - ATSPI_STATE_FOCUSED: Indicates this object currently has the keyboard
             focus.

        13 - ATSPI_STATE_HAS_TOOLTIP: Indicates that the object has an associated
             tooltip.

        14 - ATSPI_STATE_HORIZONTAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is
             horizontal.

        15 - ATSPI_STATE_ICONIFIED: Indicates this object is minimized and is
             represented only by an icon.

        16 - ATSPI_STATE_MODAL: Indicates something must be done with this object
             before the user can interact with an object in a different window.

        17 - ATSPI_STATE_MULTI_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain multiple
             lines of text.

        18 - ATSPI_STATE_MULTISELECTABLE: Indicates this object allows more than one of
             its children to be selected at the same time, or in the case of text
             objects, that the object supports non-contiguous text selections.

        19 - ATSPI_STATE_OPAQUE: Indicates this object paints every pixel within its
             rectangular region. It also indicates an alpha value of unity, if it
             supports alpha blending.

        20 - ATSPI_STATE_PRESSED: Indicates this object is currently pressed.

        21 - ATSPI_STATE_RESIZABLE: Indicates the size of this object's size is not
             fixed.

        22 - ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE: Indicates this object is the child of an object
             that allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of
             those children that can be selected.

        23 - ATSPI_STATE_SELECTED: Indicates this object is the child of an object that
             allows its children to be selected and that this child is one of those
             children that has been selected.

        24 - ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE: Indicates this object is sensitive, e.g. to user
             interaction. ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE usually accompanies.
             ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED for user-actionable controls, but may be found in the
             absence of ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED if the current visible state of the control
             is "disconnected" from the application state.  In such cases, direct user
             interaction can often result in the object gaining ATSPI_STATE_SENSITIVE,
             for instance if a user makes an explicit selection using an object whose
             current state is ambiguous or undefined. See ATSPI_STATE_ENABLED,
             ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE.

        25 - ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING: Indicates this object, the object's parent, the
             object's parent's parent, and so on, are all 'shown' to the end-user,
             i.e. subject to "exposure" if blocking or obscuring objects do not
             interpose between this object and the top of the window stack.

        26 - ATSPI_STATE_SINGLE_LINE: Indicates this (text) object can contain only a
             single line of text.

        27 - ATSPI_STATE_STALE: Indicates that the information returned for this object
             may no longer be synchronized with the application state.  This can occur
             if the object has ATSPI_STATE_TRANSIENT, and can also occur towards the
             end of the object peer's lifecycle.

        28 - ATSPI_STATE_TRANSIENT: Indicates this object is transient.

        29 - ATSPI_STATE_VERTICAL: Indicates the orientation of this object is vertical;
             for example this state may appear on such objects as scrollbars, text
             objects (with vertical text flow), separators, etc.

        30 - ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE: Indicates this object is visible, e.g. has been
             explicitly marked for exposure to the user. ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE is no
             guarantee that the object is actually unobscured on the screen, only that
             it is 'potentially' visible, barring obstruction, being scrolled or clipped
             out of the field of view, or having an ancestor container that has not yet
             made visible. A widget is potentially onscreen if it has both
             ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE and ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING. The absence of
             ATSPI_STATE_VISIBLE and ATSPI_STATE_SHOWING is
             semantically equivalent to saying that an object is 'hidden'.

        31 - ATSPI_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS: Indicates that "active-descendant-changed"
             event is sent when children become 'active' (i.e. are selected or
             navigated to onscreen).  Used to prevent need to enumerate all children
             in very large containers, like tables. The presence of
             ATSPI_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS is an indication to the client that the
             children should not, and need not, be enumerated by the client.
             Objects implementing this state are expected to provide relevant state
             notifications to listening clients, for instance notifications of
             visibility changes and activation of their contained child objects, without
             the client having previously requested references to those children.

        32 - ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE: Indicates that a check box or other boolean
             indicator is in a state other than checked or not checked.  This
             usually means that the boolean value reflected or controlled by the
             object does not apply consistently to the entire current context.
             For example, a checkbox for the "Bold" attribute of text may have
             ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE if the currently selected text contains a mixture
             of weight attributes. In many cases interacting with a
             ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE object will cause the context's corresponding
             boolean attribute to be homogenized, whereupon the object will lose
             ATSPI_STATE_INDETERMINATE and a corresponding state-changed event will be
             fired.

        33 - ATSPI_STATE_REQUIRED: Indicates that user interaction with this object is
             'required' from the user, for instance before completing the
             processing of a form.

        34 - ATSPI_STATE_TRUNCATED: Indicates that an object's onscreen content
             is truncated, e.g. a text value in a spreadsheet cell.

        35 - ATSPI_STATE_ANIMATED: Indicates this object's visual representation is
             dynamic, not static. This state may be applied to an object during an
             animated 'effect' and be removed from the object once its visual
             representation becomes static. Some applications, notably content viewers,
             may not be able to detect all kinds of animated content.  Therefore the
             absence of this state should not be taken as
             definitive evidence that the object's visual representation is
             static; this state is advisory.

        36 - ATSPI_STATE_INVALID_ENTRY: This object has indicated an error condition
             due to failure of input validation.  For instance, a form control may
             acquire this state in response to invalid or malformed user input.

        37 - ATSPI_STATE_SUPPORTS_AUTOCOMPLETION: This state indicates that the object
             in question implements some form of typeahead or
             pre-selection behavior whereby entering the first character of one or more
             sub-elements causes those elements to scroll into view or become
             selected. Subsequent character input may narrow the selection further as
             long as one or more sub-elements match the string. This state is normally
             only useful and encountered on objects that implement AtspiSelection.
             In some cases the typeahead behavior may result in full or partial
             completion of the data in the input field, in which case
             these input events may trigger text-changed events from the source.

        38 - ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE_TEXT: This state indicates that the object in
             question supports text selection. It should only be exposed on objects
             which implement the AtspiText interface, in order to distinguish this state
             from ATSPI_STATE_SELECTABLE, which infers that the object in question is a
             selectable child of an object which implements AtspiSelection. While
             similar, text selection and subelement selection are distinct operations.

        39 - ATSPI_STATE_IS_DEFAULT: This state indicates that the object in question is
             the 'default' interaction object in a dialog, i.e. the one that gets
             activated if the user presses "Enter" when the dialog is initially
             posted.

        40 - ATSPI_STATE_VISITED: This state indicates that the object (typically a
             hyperlink) has already been activated or invoked, with the result that
             some backing data has been downloaded or rendered.

        41 - ATSPI_STATE_CHECKABLE: Indicates this object has the potential to
             be checked, such as a checkbox or toggle-able table cell. Since: 2.12

        42 - ATSPI_STATE_HAS_POPUP: Indicates that the object has a popup
             context menu or sub-level menu which may or may not be
             showing. This means that activation renders conditional content.
             Note that ordinary tooltips are not considered popups in this
             context. Since: 2.12

        43 - ATSPI_STATE_READ_ONLY: Indicates that an object which is ENABLED and
             SENSITIVE has a value which can be read, but not modified, by the
             user. Since: 2.16
