      org.a11y.atspi.Socket:
      @short_description: Interface to register an application on the registry.

  <interface name="org.a11y.atspi.Socket">

    <!--
        Embed:
        @plug: a string for the unique bus name of the application, and an object path
        for the application's' root object.

        This is the entry point for an application that wants to register itself against
        the accessibility registry.  The application's root object, which it passes in
        @plug, must support the org.a11y.atspi.Application interface.

        When an application calls this method on the registry, the following handshake happens:

        * Application calls this method on the registry to identify itself.

        * The registry sets the "Id" property on the org.a11y.atspi.Application interface on the @plug object.

        * The Embed method returns with the bus name and object path for the registry's root object.

        Returns: the bus name and object path of the registry's root object.

    <!--
        Embedded:
        @path: the object path of the socket.

        This method is called by a socket to inform the plug that it is being
        embedded. The plug should register the embedding socket as its parent.

        Unembed:

        for the application's' root object.

        Unregisters an application from the accesibility registry.  It is not necessary to
        call this method; the accessibility registry detects when an application
        disconnects from the bus.
