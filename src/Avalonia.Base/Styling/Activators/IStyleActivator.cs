    /// particular use-case of activating a style according to a selector. It differs from
    /// an observable in three major ways:
    /// 
    /// - Can only have a single subscription
    /// - The activation state can be re-evaluated at any time by calling <see cref="GetIsActive"/>
    /// - No error or completion messages
