      org.a11y.atspi.Selection:
      @short_description: An interface which indicates that an object exposes
      a 'selection' model, allowing the selection of one or more of its
      children.

    <!--
        Version: The version of this interface.

        This property is incremented by one every time a new method, signal, or property
        is added to this interface.

        The number of children which are currently selected.

        GetSelectedChild:

        @selectedChildIndex: an integer indicating which of the selected
        children is specified.

        Gets the i-th selected child of the accessible.
        Note that @selectedChildIndex refers to the index in the list of
        selected children and generally differs from that used in
        GetChildAtIndex or returned by GetIndexInParent.
        @selectedChildIndex must lie between 0 and the value returned by
        GetNSelectedChildren - 1, inclusive.

        Returns: a reference (bus name + object path) of the selected child
        corresponding to the given index. If there is no selected child with
        the given index, then the special object path "/org/a11y/atspi/null"
        will be returned.

    <!--
        SelectChild:

        @childIndex: an integer indicating which child of the accessible
        is to be selected.

        Adds a child to to the accessible's list of selected children.
        For implementors that only allow         single selections, this
        may replace the (single) current         selection.

        Returns: true if the child was successfully selected, false otherwise.

        DeselectSelectedChild:

        @selectedChildIndex: a integer indicating which of the selected
        children of the accessible is to be deselected.

        Removes a child from an accessible's list of selected children.
        Note that @selectedChildIndex is the index in the selected-children list,
        not the index in the parent container.  @selectedChildIndex in this
        method and @childIndex in #atspi_selection_select_child
        are asymmetric.

        Returns: true if the child was successfully deselected, false otherwise.

        Determines whether a particular child of the accessible is

        standard accessible container's list of children.

        Returns: true if the specified child is currently selected,

        Deselects a specific child of an accessible.
