## Android Accessibility Features Aren't Implemented

Hello Avalonia team! I'm opening this issue to discuss the possiblity of using the 
Android ExploreByTouchHelper class in conjunction with the AutomationPeer API in Avalonia in 
order to add support for Android UI automation and accessiblity features.

Thoughts?

Thanks, 
Isabelle Santin
