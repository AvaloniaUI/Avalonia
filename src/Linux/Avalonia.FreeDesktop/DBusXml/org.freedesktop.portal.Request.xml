      org.freedesktop.portal.Request:
      @short_description: Shared request interface

      The Request interface is shared by all portal interfaces. When a
      portal method is called, the reply includes a handle (i.e. object path)
      for a Request object, which will stay alive for the duration of the
      user interaction related to the method call.

      The portal indicates that a portal request interaction is over by
      emitting the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response signal on the
      Request object.

      The application can abort the interaction calling
      org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Close() on the Request object.

      Since version 0.9 of xdg-desktop-portal, the handle will be of the form
       /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop/request/SENDER/TOKEN,
      where SENDER is the callers unique name, with the initial ':' removed and
      all '.' replaced by '_', and TOKEN is a unique token that the caller provided
      with the handle_token key in the options vardict.

      This change was made to let applications subscribe to the Response signal before
      making the initial portal call, thereby avoiding a race condition. It is recommended
      that the caller should verify that the returned handle is what it expected, and update
      its signal subscription if it isn't. This ensures that applications will work with both
      old and new versions of xdg-desktop-portal.

      The token that the caller provides should be unique and not guessable. To avoid clashes
      with calls made from unrelated libraries, it is a good idea to use a per-library prefix
      combined with a random number.
