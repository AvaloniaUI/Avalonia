            // to the next color (e.g., how far we are from pure red towards yellow), and give a value to the partially present channel
            // equal to the minimum plus the chroma (i.e., the max minus the min), multiplied by the percentage towards the new color.
            // This gets us a value between the maximum and the minimum representing the partially present channel.
