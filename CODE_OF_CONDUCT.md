# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Respecting that contributors and maintainers have invested significant effort in building this project
* Keeping discussions focused on improving Avalonia and its ecosystem
* When discussing alternatives, doing so with relevant technical context that advances the conversation

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Repeated unsolicited promotion, recruitment, or calls to action for external projects, products, or services in Avalonia’s official channels, particularly when it derails technical discussion or continues after redirection
* Using Avalonia’s official channels to organise or coordinate work for unrelated projects rather than collaborating on Avalonia
* Posting promotional content primarily to drive traffic, sales, or contributors, rather than to contribute to the topic at hand

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Avalonia’s official infrastructure exists to support Avalonia’s development and community. Constructive technical criticism and relevant comparisons are welcome. What is not welcome is repeated promotional activity, recruitment, or organising unrelated projects within Avalonia’s official channels.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
steven@avaloniaui.net.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### Specific Guidance: Infrastructure Misuse and Promotion
**Community Impact:** A pattern of using Avalonia’s official channels primarily to promote external projects, products, or services, recruit contributors, or coordinate unrelated work, especially where it derails ongoing technical discussion or continues after a moderator request to stop.

**Consequence:** Moderators will remove promotional content immediately to keep discussions focused. If the behaviour appears unintentional or isolated, moderators will follow up privately with guidance and redirect to appropriate venues (e.g., AvaloniaCommunity org, personal blogs). Repeated violations after guidance will result in a formal warning and, if continued, restriction from project platforms up to and including a permanent ban.

*Note: This guidance addresses patterns of disruption and misuse of shared channels. It does not prohibit technical criticism, benchmarks, or mentioning alternatives when relevant and explained with technical context.*

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, aggression towards or disparagement of classes of individuals, or persistent misuse of project infrastructure after warnings.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
