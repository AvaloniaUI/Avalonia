## 📖 About AvaloniaUI 

Avalonia is a cross-platform XAML-based UI framework providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of Operating Systems such as Windows via .NET Framework and .NET Core, Linux via Xorg, macOS. Avalonia is ready for **General-Purpose Desktop App Development**. However, there may be some bugs and breaking changes as we continue along into this project's development.

> **Note:** The UI theme you see in the picture above is still work-in-progress and will be available in the upcoming Avalonia 0.10.0 release. However, you can connect to our nightly build feed and install latest pre-release versions of Avalonia NuGet packages, if you are willing to help out with the development and testing. See [Using nightly build feed](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Using-nightly-build-feed) for more info.

To see the status of some of our features, please see our [Roadmap](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/2239). You can also see what [breaking changes](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/3538) we have planned and what our [past breaking changes](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Breaking-Changes) have been.

## JetBrains Rider

If you need to develop Avalonia app with JetBrains Rider, go and *vote* on [this issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-39247) in their tracker. JetBrains won't do things without their users telling them that they want the feature, so only **YOU** can make it happen.

## Bleeding Edge Builds

We also have a [nightly build](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Using-nightly-build-feed) which tracks the current state of master. Although these packages are less stable than the release on NuGet.org, you'll get all the latest features and bugfixes right away and many of our users actually prefer this feed!

## Documentation

Documentation can be found on our website at http://avaloniaui.net/docs/. We also have a [tutorial](http://avaloniaui.net/docs/tutorial/) over there for newcomers.
