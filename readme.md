## About

**Avalonia** is a cross-platform XAML-based UI framework providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of Operating Systems such as Windows (.NET Framework, .NET Core), Linux (via Xorg), macOS.

**Avalonia** is ready for **General-Purpose Desktop App Development**. However, there may be some bugs and breaking changes as we continue along into this project's development.

To see the status of some of our features, please see our [Roadmap here](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/2239).

You can also see what [breaking changes](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/issues/3538) we have planned and what our [past breaking changes](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Breaking-Changes) have been.

[Awesome Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/awesome-avalonia) is community-curated list of awesome Avalonia UI tools, libraries, projects and resources. Go and see what people are building with Avalonia!

## Getting Started

The Avalonia [Visual Studio Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaforVisualStudio) contains project and control templates that will help you get started, or you can use the .NET Core CLI. For a starer guide see our [documentation](http://avaloniaui.net/docs/quickstart/create-new-project).

Avalonia is delivered via <b>NuGet</b> package manager. You can find the packages here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Avalonia/

Use these commands in the Package Manager console to install Avalonia manually:
```
Install-Package Avalonia
Install-Package Avalonia.Desktop
```

## JetBrains Rider

If you need to develop Avalonia app with JetBrains Rider, go and *vote* on [this issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-39247) in their tracker. JetBrains won't do things without their users telling them that they want the feature, so only **YOU** can make it happen.

## Bleeding Edge Builds

We also have a [nightly build](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Using-nightly-build-feed) which tracks the current state of master. Although these packages are less stable than the release on NuGet.org, you'll get all the latest features and bugfixes right away and many of our users actually prefer this feed!

## Documentation

Documentation can be found on our website at http://avaloniaui.net/docs/. We also have a [tutorial](http://avaloniaui.net/docs/tutorial/) over there for newcomers.
