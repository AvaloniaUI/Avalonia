## 📖 About 

[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net) is a cross-platform UI framework for dotnet, providing a flexible styling system and supporting a wide range of platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android and WebAssembly. Avalonia is mature and production ready and is used by companies, including [Schneider Electric](https://avaloniaui.net/showcase#se), [Unity](https://avaloniaui.net/showcase#unity), [JetBrains](https://avaloniaui.net/showcase#rider) and [GitHub](https://avaloniaui.net/showcase#github).

Considered by many to be the spiritual successor to WPF, Avalonia UI provides a familiar, modern development experience for XAML developers creating cross-platform applications. While Avalonia UI is [similar to WPF](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/get-started/wpf/), it isn't a 1:1 copy, and you'll find plenty of improvements. 

For those seeking a cross-platform WPF, we have created [Avalonia XPF](https://avaloniaui.net/xpf), enabling WPF applications to run on macOS and Linux with little to no code changes. Avalonia XPF is a commercial product and is licensed per-app, per-platform.
