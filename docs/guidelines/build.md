# Building Avalonia

## Windows

Avalonia requires at least Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Core SDK 2.0 to build on Windows.

### Install GTK Sharp

For the moment under windows, you must have [gtk-sharp](http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win)
installed. Note that after installing the package your machine may require a restart before GTK# is
added to your path. We hope to remove or make this dependency optional at some point in the future.

### Clone the Avalonia repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.git
git submodule update --init
```

### Open in Visual Studio

Open the `Avalonia.sln` solution in Visual Studio 2015 or newer. The free Visual Studio Community
edition works fine. Run the `Samples\ControlCatalog.Desktop` project to see the sample application.

## Linux/OSX

It's *not* possible to build the *whole* project on Linux/OSX. You can only build the subset targeting .NET Standard and .NET Core (which is, however, sufficient to get UI working on Linux/OSX). If you want to something that involves changing platform-specific APIs you'll need a Windows machine.

MonoDevelop, Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio for Mac aren't capable of properly opening our solution. You can use Rider (at least 2017.2 EAP) or VSCode instead. They will fail to load most of platform specific projects, but you don't need them to run on .NET Core.

### Install the latest version of .NET Core

Go to https://www.microsoft.com/net/core and follow instructions for your OS. You need SDK (not just "runtime") package.

### Clone the Avalonia repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build and Run Avalonia

```
samples/ControlCatalog.NetCore
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
